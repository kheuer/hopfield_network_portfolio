# Hopfield Network
Nature has always been an inspiration for our technology. Copying properties of our brain into a machine is
an interesting problem that has been investigated with Hopfield Networks that can already form memory. 

A Hopfield Network is a type of recurrent artificial neural network that can be used for pattern recognition, optimization, and associative memory tasks. It consists of a set of neurons, where each neuron is connected to every other neuron in the network. The connections between the neurons are known as weights, and they are symmetrically set to learn from the patterns provided during training.

During training, the network learns to store a set of input patterns by adjusting the weights between the neurons. The network can then recall these patterns when presented with an incomplete or noisy version of the input pattern. This process is called associative memory.

Hopfield Networks work by minimizing an energy function defined by the weights between the neurons. When the network is presented with an incomplete or noisy pattern, it iteratively updates the states of the neurons until it converges to a stable state. The stable state represents the closest stored pattern that matches the input pattern.

Hopfield Networks have been used in a variety of applications such as image and speech recognition, combinatorial optimization problems, and data compression.
I wrote a Paper explain the Hopfield Network, McCulloch’s and Pitt’s, Proof of Decreasing Energy and the effect of different system sizes and Hyperparameters together with my college Henricus Bracht.  [The Paper can be found here](./an_examination_of_hopfield_networks.pdf).
