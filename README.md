# Hopfield Network
Nature has always been an inspiration for our technology. Copying properties of our brain into a machine is
an interesting problem that has been investigated with Hopfield Networks that can already form memory. 
This project aims to contextualize Hopfield Networks in the evolution of digital replication of "intelligence" and to
draw conclusions from tweaking parameters. Furthermore, we examined the relevance of Hopfield Networks.
For these purposes, we have developed the Hopfield Network implementation seen in this Repository.
